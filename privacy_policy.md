# Privacy Policy - Saber

Saber is an application developed by Adil Hanney that facilitates the user creating and organising handwritten notes.

With the exception of the notes created by the user, Saber does not record or access any other personal or sensitive user data. The application does not use any third-party tracking APIs.
The application does not (yet) access the internet, and does not use any unnecessary permissions: notes are stored locally on the device.

The source code is free and open to the public under the
[GPLv3 license](https://github.com/adil192/saber/blob/main/LICENSE.md),
and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adil192/saber).

This privacy policy will change as the app evolves, most notably when cloud services are provided. You can view any changes on this page, and can track early progress through the [Saber progress discussion](https://github.com/adil192/saber/discussions/1) and through the changelogs on the [Releases](https://github.com/adil192/saber/releases) page.
