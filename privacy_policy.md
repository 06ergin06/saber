# Privacy Policy - Saber

Saber does not record or access any personal or sensitive user data, except for the notes created by the user.
The application does not (yet) access the internet, and does not use any unnecessary permissions: notes are stored locally on the device.
The source code is free and open to the public under the
[GPLv3 license](https://github.com/adil192/saber/blob/main/LICENSE.md),
and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/adil192/saber).

This privacy policy will change as the app evolves, most notably when cloud services are provided. You can view any changes on this page.
