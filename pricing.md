# Pricing

The app is free to use. However, to support Saber's development and fund the server,
I'm offering some storage plans for the Saber Nextcloud server...

| Sponsorship          | Storage                                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Free                 | All accounts by default get 500MB of storage.        |
| Any amount per month | Sponsor me any amount per month for 2GB of storage.  |
| â‰¥ $5 per month       | Sponsor me $5 or more per month for 10GB of storage. |

All sponsorships are in USD ($) because of GitHub Sponsors.

## How to sponsor

- Go to https://github.com/sponsors/adil192
- Select the amount you want to sponsor me per month
- Enter your card details or pay with PayPal
- Email me at adilhanney@disroot.org with your Nextcloud username and
  confirmation of your sponsorship, and I'll upgrade your account!
